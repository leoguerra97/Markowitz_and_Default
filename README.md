# Markowitz Optimization and Bank Default Prediction

This repository contains two distinct yet complementary tasks focused on financial analytics and predictive modeling. It demonstrates the application of optimization techniques and machine learning to solve real-world financial problems.

## Project Overview

### Task 1: Markowitz Portfolio Optimization
This task focuses on portfolio optimization using the **Markowitz framework**. Key features include:
- **Optimization Constraints**: Implements and visualizes the impact of constraints such as **no short selling**.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Explores the effects of **Lasso** and **Ridge regularization** on portfolio weights to achieve robust solutions.
- **Rolling Window Approach**: Employs a **rolling train-test window** to analyze portfolio performance over time, mimicking real-world market conditions.
- **Optimization Algorithm**: Utilizes the **SLSQP (Sequential Least Squares Programming)** algorithm from `scipy.optimize.minimize` for efficient constrained optimization.

**Visualizations**: The notebook provides clear and intuitive plots for:
- Efficient frontiers under different constraints and regularization methods.
- Portfolio weight trajectories across time.

### Task 2: Bank Default Prediction
This task builds a predictive model to identify the likelihood of bank defaults. Highlights include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Development**: Implements various machine learning models and compares their performance on classification metrics.
- **Visualization of Results**: Visualizes key results such as feature importance, confusion matrices, and ROC curves for interpretability and evaluation.
